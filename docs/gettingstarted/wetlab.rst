Plate Layout
============

Equipt accommodates a variety of plate layouts, but it is intentionally limited to facilitate automated well labeling. The more layouts equipt supports, the more user specifications are necessary, the more likely user errors become. 

Equipt can handle 96- or 384-well plates. It expects the user to plate 2, 3, or 4 replicate wells in either a square or line template as described below.
